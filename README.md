# Apple-clone
This is a frontend clone of the official Apple website built using React and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on recreating Apple's clean, minimal, and responsive design using modern frontend technologies. It includes components like the header, hero sections, product banners, and footer, all styled to reflect Appleâ€™s aesthetic.
